            <p>I build stuff and I try to make it available to as many people as possible. For free.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>IMDb API</b> There's no official IMDb API that allows you to fetch titles. So I built a scraper that would fetch the data and massage it as a pretty extensive (?) JSON API. Check it out <a href="https://github.com/kunalnagar/expressyo-imdb-scraper">here</a>.<br /><small><i>A Vue.js component is also in the works and once finished, I will use it to show my watch list on the home page of this website.</i></small>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Custom 404 Pro</b> A WordPress plugin that allows you to replace the default 404 page with a custom page. It can be one of the pages under the Pages section or a completely different URL. All 404s can be logged and can be exported if needed. <a href="/blog/custom-404-pro/">Read more</a> about it or <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-404-pro/">download</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>jquery.peekABar</b> A jQuery notification bar plugin that does the job. Put it on the top or the bottom. Style it however you want, animate it, the works. Take a <a href="http://kunalnagar.github.io/jquery.peekABar/">look</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>jquery.ghostfm</b> A fan of last.fm? Use this to showcase your listening history. Are you a minimalist? There's a mini widget for you too. Check it <a href="https://kunalnagar.github.io/jquery.ghostfm/">out</a>.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>I tinker around. When I see stuff on the internet that's challenging, I try to re-create it. This contains demos, experimental stuff, and things that I may or may not complete in the future.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>MailChimp signup form</b> This is how signup forms should be. Especially the password section. I try to re-create it <a href="http://kunalnagar.github.io/mailchimp-signup/">here</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Clipboard Demo</b> Demos to copy input/paragraph elements to the Clipboard. <a href="https://kunalnagar.github.io/clipboard-demo/">No library</a> required.

            <b>YouTube Jukebox</b> Subscribed to a lot of channels? Want a way to watch the important ones first? Quickly add them to a <a href="/blog/chrome-extension-youtube-jukebox/">jukebox</a>, sit back and relax.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>AdStomp</b> I hate ads. But that's how <i>most</i> free content is offered on the Internet. <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/adstomp/omoobfkabeoablabejdmodnablfjjbch">AdStomp</a> helps you with that without triggering adblock warnings.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Node.js file upload</b> The basic stuff. Upload a file and get percentage updates. No demo but here's the <a href="https://github.com/kunalnagar/nodejs-basic-file-upload">project</a>.
        </li>
