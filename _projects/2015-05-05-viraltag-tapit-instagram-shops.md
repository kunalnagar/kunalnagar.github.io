TapIt is a product of Viraltag that allows brands to convert their Instagram Feed into a Shoppable E-Commerce Store.

You can choose the images you want to add to the Feed and link it to a product on your E-Commerce Store.

Most images that you add to the feed have multiple products in them. You can add multiple products from the Admin area and they will show up in the shop as well. Checkout the screenshots for more details.

Users can even connect their Instagram account. Once done, they can go to the Instagram app and start liking the brand images. We analyse that pattern and send you an email that contains more details about that product! How cool is that?
