Hi! My name is Kunal Nagar.

I'm currently looking for Front-End opportunities in Toronto as a Permanent Resident.

Most recently, I worked at [ScaleGrid][scalegrid], enabling users to manage their database clusters by creating dashboards and monitoring solutions.

Before that, I worked at [Viraltag][viraltag], a social media scheduling tool where I built their scheduler, chrome extension and iOS application from scratch.

My primary job is to use JavaScript responsibly.
