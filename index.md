Hi. I'm Kunal.

I work as a Frontend Developer at [HomeX][homex] where we allow users to seamlessly schedule home service appointments.

Most recently, I worked at [ScaleGrid][scalegrid], enabling users to manage their database clusters by creating dashboards and monitoring solutions.

Before that, I was at [Viraltag][viraltag], a social media scheduling tool where I built their scheduler, chrome extension and iOS application from scratch.

Use JavaScript responsibly. Make the web faster, and a little [whimsical](/404).
