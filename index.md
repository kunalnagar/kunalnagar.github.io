Hi. I'm Katia.

I work as a Senior Frontend Developer at [CircleCI][circleci] where we help automate the software delivery pipeline so developers can ship quality applications more efficiently.

Most recently, I worked at [HomeX][homex], that allows users to seamlessly schedule home service appointments.

Before that, I was at [ScaleGrid][scalegrid], enabling users to manage their database clusters by creating dashboards and monitoring solutions.

Use JavaScript responsibly. Make the web faster, and a little [whimsical](/404).
