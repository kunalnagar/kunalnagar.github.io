Bartender 2 for Mac OS X is an amazing piece of software that allows you to de-clutter your OS X Menu Bar. You can organise your menu bar apps by moving or rearranging them or moving them to the Bartender Bar.

## Features

Here are some of the top features:

* Lets you tidy your menu bar apps how you want.
* See your menu bar apps when you want.
* Hide the apps you need to run, but do not need to see.
* Have the clean looking menu bar you want.
* Re-arrange the menu bar items as you wish.

## Take Control of your Menu Bar

Bartender allows you to choose which apps stay in the menu bar and which apps are hidden under the Bartender Bar.

## Bartender Bar

Clicking on the Bartender icon will reveal the Bartender Bar. You can also assign a Hotkey to it like Alfred.

## Other Features

Here are some additional features:

* Recently updated apps with a notification will be shown outside the Bartender Bar (if hidden) for a certain amount of time that can be configured.
* Re-order all your menu bar items.
* Bartender Bar can be placed anywhere you want.
* It even hides the Notification Centre Icon.

It has also been featured in popular blogs such as [MacStories][macstories] and [MacWorld][macworld].

## Pricing

Bartender 2 is free to download for try for 4 weeks. After that, you need to purchase the full version which costs **$15** and I highly recommend that you buy it if you like a clean minimal OS X Menu Bar.
