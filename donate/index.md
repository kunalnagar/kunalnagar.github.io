Hello there! If you're on this page, then you must love my Open Source work. Here are some of the projects that I'm maintaining actively:

* [Custom 404 Pro][custom-404-pro]: 
A WordPress plugin that allows users to replace the default 404 page with a custom page from the Pages section in the Admin Panel. Or you can specify a complete URL to redirect on 404.
<b>Active Installs: 8,000+</b>

* [jQuery.peekABar][jquery-peek-a-bar]:
It is the Ultimate Notification Bar Plugin built on top of jQuery.
<b>Total Downloads: 10,000+</b>

If you like the work that I do, please consider making a small donation. Thank you for inspiring me to build these amazing plugins :)
