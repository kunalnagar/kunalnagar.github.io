My name is Kunal Nagar and this is my blog.

I was introduced to programming through the world of [Logo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)) and [QBasic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QBasic) and enjoyed it so much that I decided to make a career out of it.

After doing my graduation from [Pune Institute of Computer Technology](http://pict.edu/), I was introduced to [Apex Salesforce](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.apexcode.meta/apexcode/apex_intro_what_is_apex.htm) and worked on it for a year in Jaipur. I then decided to do my Masters from [BITS Dubai](http://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/dubai/) where I got the opportunity to work on the college Intranet Projects using [PHP](http://php.net/).

I loved PHP so much that I came back to Jaipur and started doing Freelance work for 2 years. Being a Freelancer introduces you to the entire stack of Web Development (Backend + Frontend) that enable you to build applications from scratch. From here, I branched out to using [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/), [CakePHP](http://cakephp.org/), [Codeigniter](https://www.codeigniter.com/) and [Laravel](https://laravel.com/).

In 2015, I got an offer to work for a Social Media Startup called [Viraltag](https://www.viraltag.com/), so I packed my bags and moved to Bangalore. Since then, I'm a full-time Frontend Developer. I had worked on [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) before during my Freelance days and at Viraltag, I got a chance to work on [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/), [Marionette.js](http://marionettejs.com/) and [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/).

I currently work at [ScaleGrid Inc](https://scalegrid.io/) where I build experiences on the web that allow users to manage and host their databases ([MongoDB&reg;](https://www.mongodb.com/) & [Redis&reg;](http://redis.io/)).
