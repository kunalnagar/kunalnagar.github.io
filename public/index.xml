      <description>So my parents listen to music on YouTube. Because apparently, services like Saavn or Gaana don&amp;rsquo;t make sense to them. And honestly, I can&amp;rsquo;t blame them. They&amp;rsquo;re gonna use what seems familiar to them.
One day they asked me - how can I download this song to my phone and listen to it without opening the YouTube app? And I suggested numerous YouTube to Mp3 converters on the internet.</description>

      <description>Note: Contains more cursing than usual. Reader discretion is advised.
May 13, 2015 - I move to an apartment in Bangalore to start my new job and get my own high speed internet connection, or as the cool kids say - Fibernet connection. I was so happy. I mean, wouldn&amp;rsquo;t you be if you got this kind of a speedtest?

      <title>Rewrite WordPress Multisites</title>

      <description>Recently, one of my tasks was to create a Blog and a Knowledge Base and use similar credentials and login-flows for both of their Admin Consoles. Without a doubt, WordPress Multisite is the perfect choice for this since you don&amp;rsquo;t have to manage your Auth/Settings/Dashboard in multiple places.
Note: Creating WordPress multisites is out of the scope of this article. For more info, check out this link.
When you set up a WordPress Multisite install, you create one root site and then all other multisites are created as subfolders (children).</description>

      <title>Shared Modules using RequireJS</title>
      <link>http://kunalnagar.in/blog/shared-modules-using-requirejs/</link>

      <guid>http://kunalnagar.in/blog/shared-modules-using-requirejs/</guid>
      <description>Every application needs a set of modules that are shared across all other modules. Things like String/Array helpers, Loggers etc are used across your application and it makes sense to create wrappers around them and expose them via a Common Module.
Before we start, I&amp;rsquo;m assuming that you know a bit about RequireJS. If not, I suggest you visit their website and learn about AMD (Asynchronous Module Definition).
Here is the basic folder structure that we&amp;rsquo;re going to follow.</description>

      <description>In this article, we will be creating the Clone Widget on GitHub that allows you to copy a Repo URL by clicking a button. It works natively in Chrome and falls back to Flash in Firefox &amp;amp; Safari. If Flash is not installed, the Copy button is not shown, but the user can still select the path and copy it manually.
Here is how the widget looks natively in Chrome (Copy button enabled)</description>

      <description>YouTube is great. I use it all the time to learn, relax, listen to music and probably have a laugh or two. So I built a Chrome Extension that is a lighter version of YouTube Playlists.
It adds two things to youtube.com:
 An &amp;ldquo;Add to Jukebox&amp;rdquo; button next to every video A Sidebar for consuming videos and making a list  As soon as you activate the extension, you‚Äôll see an ‚ÄúAdd to Jukebox‚Äù button next to every video on YouTube.</description>

      <description>Custom 404 Pro is a WordPress plugin that allows users to override the default 404 page with any page from the WordPress Dashboard. You can even redirect users to a different URL everytime you get a 404. It has 8,000+ active installs as of August 2016.
While this may sound trivial to many developers, I built this for people who are less technical and don&amp;rsquo;t know how to write PHP.</description>

      <description>Setting up push notifications in a hybrid mobile app can be a challenging task if you don‚Äôt know the mechanics of it. Fortunately, Ionic‚Äôs ngCordova service allows us to handle push notifications easily. This article assumes that you have a basic understanding of Hybrid Mobile Applications and how to deploy them to an Android device. If not, I will try and mention the steps explicitly when I can. Please also note that this is not a Getting Started Tutorial for Ionic and you need to have a development environment setup beforehand with the Android SDK.</description>

      <description>The past week has been an absolute disaster for me as far as Web Security is concerned. My Macbook Pro picked up an adware from some shitty website that would not show up in most Adware Removal Tools. It was after a lot of research and thanks to Thomas from The Safe Mac that I managed to fix the problem. In this article, I will guide you through the process and how I realised that the problem was not on my Mac, but in my Modem.</description>
